### Dynamic Place

This is a convenient way to add physic falling and force field effects to object.  
Physics only effects to same level objects, if you put a object to the active object's parent collection or sub collection, it won't join the physic simulation.

- **Drag Force**: Select objects and drag the gizmo in Drag mode, you can make simple falling effect.
- **Scale Force**: Select objects and drag the gizmm in Scale mode, you can make simple gravitation effect.
